## Codeblog  
  



### Description  
To be honestðŸ˜…, this is my third blog website till now. Before this, I have two beginner-level blog projects which its both backend and frontend part is made by me. But the major difference between this and the other two projects is, this project is developed using Django Rest framework rather than Django, HTML & CSS. It is a minor project for NTTC(Non-Teaching Credit Course) at my university. It is not finished yet, it needs some changes and additional features, plus front end part is not finished.
